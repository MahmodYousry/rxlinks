# What is Rxlinks?

Rxlinks is a **personal link hub**: one page where you keep your favourite websites, grouped by category.

---

## In simple terms

- You see **cards** (icons + names) for each link.
- Links are grouped into **categories** (e.g. AI, Popular, Social, Games, Tools).
- You can **search** by name or category.
- You can switch between **light** and **dark** theme.
- All links open in a **new tab** when you click them.

No login, no backend. It’s just a page that loads a list of links from a file. You can edit that file to add or remove links without writing code.

## Who is it for?

- Anyone who wants a **single page** with their go-to links.
- People who prefer to **edit a JSON file** instead of a big codebase to change links.
- Developers learning **Angular** (standalone components, routing, services).

## What it is *not*

- Not a bookmark sync service (no account, no cloud).
- Not a browser extension (it’s a web app you run locally or host yourself).
